# SkimLit Project

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build an NLP model to make reading medical abstracts easier. In the the general notebook you could see all the process for the data preparation and the different experiments to achieve the  architecture used in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.06071

## Main Features
* Train a NLP model using a tribrid embedding
* Transfer Learning with a pretrained toklen embedding
* Chracter level and positional embeddin
* Data preparation and prefetching preparation
* Metrics comparative amonmg the different experiments
